# C++ Threading and Synchronization Demo

This C++ project serves as a demonstration of various threading and synchronization features. It covers fundamental concepts such as mutexes, condition variables, atomic operations, asynchronous task execution, and communication between threads.

## Features

Thread Locking and Synchronization:
    Basic usage of std::mutex and std::condition_variable for thread synchronization.

 Thread Yielding:
    Utilization of std::this_thread::yield()` to allow threads to voluntarily yield their turn.

 Atomic Operations:
    Safe incrementing of a counter using std::atomic.

 Asynchronous Task Execution:
   Use of std::packaged_task for asynchronous execution of a simple addition function.

 Communication Between Threads:
   Demonstration of inter-thread communication using std::promise and std::future.

## How to Use

 Compile the Code:
    Use a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++11 -o main main.cpp
